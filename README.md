# IBM_SpaceX_DataScience_Capstone
This is a Capstone project I did for my IBM Data Science Professional Certificate.
## Project background and context:
- This project analyzes data to predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully.
- SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars, while other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each. Much of this savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage.
- Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information will be used by the client SPACE-Y to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch. 
## Objectives and key deliverables:
- Predict the price of each launch
- Predict if SpaceX will reuse their first stage.
- Determine the best location for a launch.
